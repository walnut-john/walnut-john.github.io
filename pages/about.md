# About Me

I'm John Walker and I'm learning about data science, machine learning, and programming. I am using this site as more/less a showcase of my projects and learnings throughout this process.

## Education

I've studied economics at Kennesaw State University and have recently completed a masters in analytics program at Georgia Tech. I'm constantly learning more about data science and machine learning through various online resources and books - I plan to post a list of the resources I've found helpful soon. 

## Hobbies

Aside from my profressional interests - I enjoy playing guitar, fitness, some Xbox, and hiking when I have the oppotunity.
