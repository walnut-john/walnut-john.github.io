# Portfolio

This is a collection of some of my data science/analytics projects. They are Jupyter Notebooks (using Python) which have been converted to html format. Please [reach out](https://linkedin.com/in/johnwalkerr) to me if you find anything interesting, or spot any errors.   

## [Bayesian "Just Busted" Analysis](projects/Bayesian-Data-Analysis.html)

Used BeautifulSoup to scrape a website for Just Busted data, performed data cleanup and EDA, then implemented Bayesian models using the [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io) library.
